> [!NOTE]
> This board is the most basic version, and there are no external Ethernet.And we have also replaced the audio part, which consists of msm261d and ns4168. We will lead out the pin and can directly insert the expansion board later, and also reserve more creative possibilities for everyone

## 4.Instructions for Use
This tutorial aims to guide users to set up the software environment for ESP32-P4 hardware development, and demonstrates how to use the ESP-IDF configuration menu, compile, and download firmware to the ESP32-P4 development board through simple examples.

- Preparation
- Hardware
  - ESP32-P4-Pi-VIEWE Development Board
  - USB data cable (Type-A to Type-C, prepared as needed)
  - Computer (Windows, Linux or macOS)
- Software (It is recommended to install ESP-IDF using an integrated development environment. If you are familiar with ESP-IDF, you can start directly from the ESP-IDF terminal. You can choose any of the following development methods.)
  - VSCode + ESP-IDF plugin (recommended)
  - Eclipse + ESP-IDF plugin (Espressif-IDE)
  - Arduino IDE

## 5.Getting-start
### ESP-IDF
  - Please go to [ESP-IDF Quick Start](https://github.com/VIEWESMART/VIEWE-Tutorial/blob/main/esp-idf/esp-idf_Beginner_Tutorial.md) to see how to quickly set up the development environment and burn the application to your development board.
  - The application examples for the development board are stored in Examples. You can configure the project options by entering idf.py menuconfig in the [examples](https://github.com/VIEWESMART/ESP32-P4-SmartDisplay/tree/main/examples/esp-idf) directory.It includes usage instructions. If they haven't been added yet, please be patient as we are adding them one by one. You can also contact us, and we will handle it with priority.

### Arduino IDE
We are working hard to prepare. If you need anything, please contact us.
